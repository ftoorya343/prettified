I am passionate about making python as clean as possible. Collected here are some select before and afters. A number of errors were identified in the cleaning process, creating some fundamental problems that would give errors by multiple orders of magnitude. Additionally, lines were cut by as much as 50% and speed increased as much as 80%.
